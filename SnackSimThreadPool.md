### jobList
List of simulator jobs waiting to be run
## Methods


### OnThreadSimulationComplete(Snacks.SimSnacks)
Handles the completion of a thread's simulation.
> #### Parameters
> **simulator:** The simulator that just finished.


### OnThreadSimulatorCycleComplete(Snacks.SimSnacks)
Handles completion of a thread's simulation cycle.
> #### Parameters
> **simulator:** The simulator that just completed its cycle.


### OnSimulatorException(Snacks.SimSnacks,System.Exception)
Handles the exception generated by a simulator.
> #### Parameters
> **simulator:** The simulator that generated the exception.

> **ex:** The Exception generated.


### LockResourceDurations
Locks the vessel resource durations so that we can query them. Be sure to call UnlockResourceDurations when done.

### UnlockResourceDurations
Unlocks resource durations so that threads can operate on them.

### GetVesselResourceDurations(Vessel)
Returns the vessel resource definitions for the requested vessel. Be sure to call LockResourceDurations before calling this method. Be sure to call UnlockResourceDurations after you're done.
> #### Parameters
> **vessel:** The vessel to query

> #### Return value
> The resource durations for the specified vessel, or null if they don't exist.

### ConvertersAssumedActive(Vessel)
Determines whether or not the simulator had to assume that converters were on.
> #### Parameters
> **vessel:** The vessel to query

> #### Return value
> true if the simulator couldn't determine activation state and had to assume converters were on; false if not.

### RemoveVesselResourceDurations(Vessel)
Removes the vessel resource durations for the specified vessel if they exist. Be sure to call LockResourceDurations before calling this method. Be sure to call UnlockResourceDurations after you're done.
> #### Parameters
> **vessel:** The vessel that will no longer have resource durations.


### AddSimulatorJob(Snacks.SimSnacks)
Adds a simulator to the job list.
> #### Parameters
> **simulator:** The SimSnacks simulator to add to the list.


### StopAllJobs
Stops all current and pending jobs.
