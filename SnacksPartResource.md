            
When a part with crew capacity is loaded in the editor and it lacks this resource, or when a vessel is loaded into the scene and its parts with crew capacity lack this resource, add it to the part. Doesnâ€™t apply to kerbals going on EVA. Use SNACKS_EVA_RESOURCE for that. Use the SNACKS_PART_RESOURCE to define resources to add.
        
## Fields

### resourceName
Name of the resource
### amount

### capacityAffectingModules
Parts with at least one of the modules on this list affect the part's capacity to store the resource (their equipment takes up additional space, for instance).
### capacityMultiplier
If a part has at least one part module on the capacityAffectingModules list then multiply resource amount and max amount by this multiplier. Default is 1.0
### isPerKerbal
If true (which is the default), then amount and maxAmount added are multiplied by the part's crew capacity.
