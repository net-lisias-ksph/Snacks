Starts the thread.

### Stop
Stops all current and pending jobs and kills the thread.

### AddJob(Snacks.SimSnacks)
Adds a simulator job to the job list.
> #### Parameters
> **simSnacks:** The simulator to add to the jobs list.


### ClearJobs
Clears all pending and running jobs.

###

### 
Determines whether or not the simulator had to assume that converters were on.
> #### Parameters
> **vessel:** The vessel to query

> #### Return value
> true if the simulator couldn't determine activation state and had to assume converters were on; false if not.

### 
Removes the vessel resource durations for the specified vessel if they exist. Be sure to call LockResourceDurations before calling this method. Be sure to call UnlockResourceDurations after you're done.
> #### Parameters
> **vessel:** The vessel that will no longer have resource durations.


###
