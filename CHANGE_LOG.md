# Snacks Continued :: Change Log

* 2019-0806: 1.22 (Angel-125) for KSP 1.7.3
	+ Added support for Dynamic Batteries.
	+ Added ability to interrupt the resource consumption simulator. NOTE: duration estimates will be unavailable.
	+ Fix Inability to view vessels not on or around the current world.
	+ Fix Missing roster resource names when added to the kerbal.
* 2019-0727: 1.21 (Angel-125) for KSP 1.7.3
	+ CheckResources can now check resource percent levels.
	+ Fix Simulator window not running simulations after closing and reopening the window in the same scene.
	+ Fix NRE generated by FaintPenalty.
	+ Fix estimated time remaining display showing 1 hour even when out of resources.
	+ Fix Snacks converters and their derivatives give players a break on ElectricCharge consumption past 100x timewarp.
	+ Fix background converters honor infinite electricity and infinite propellant debug settings.
	+ Fix "Hydrazine" Vodka display name.
* 2019-0716: 1.20.3 (Angel-125) for KSP 1.7.3
	+ Fix snack tin symmetry issues.
	+ Fix NREs when changing resources.
* 2019-0630: 1.20.2 (Angel-125) for KSP 1.7.3
	+ When I started reworking Snacks to add in the penalty system, I tried to follow the same design philosophies that Squad did when making KerbNet: make it a challenge but don't brick your game or save. I've kept that philosophy and stuck to the original concept as a lightweight life support system as I've made improvements over the years. This update is the collmination of weeks of work that keeps the simplistic life support out of the box but opens the doors to so much more. All it needs is a bit of legwork on your part, but there are plenty of examples.
	+ I'm happy to say that Snacks is feature complete!
	+ Custom Life Support Resources: Snacks now has the ability to define custom life support resources besides just Snacks! All it takes is a config file. With this feature you can:
			- Define your own life support resource to consume and/or produce.
			- Optionally track its status in the vessel snapshot window- with support in the multithreaded simulator!
			- Optionally apply one or more outcomes (like penalties) if the consumed resource runs out, or if space for the produced resource is full.
	+ As an example of a tracked resource, check out the LifeSupportResources folder for the FreshAir.txt file. Rename it with the .cfg extension to enable it.
	+ NOTE: You can make FreshAir using the stock ISRU and mini ISRU, and all the stock crew cabins have Air Scrubber converters to turn StaleAir into FreshAir.
	+ New Part: SOCS! Similar to the real-world Solid Fuel Oxygen Generator, the Solid Oxium Candle System burns a solid fuel to produce Fresh Air. Once started it can't be stopped and it might explode... It's available at the Survivability tech tree node, and only available if you enable Air.
	+ Roster Resource: Roster resources can now be defined via the SNACKS_ROSTER_RESOURCE config node. A roster resource is a characteristic of a kerbal as opposed to a resource stored in a part. Better yet, the SnacksConverter can work with roster resources- with background processing!
	+ New penalty: The OnStrikePenalty removes a kerbal's skill set without turning him or her into a tourist. That way, should you uninstall the mod for some reason, you won't brick your mission or game.
	+ Stress: You now have an optional resource to keep track of: Stress! Stress reflects the difficulties of living in confined spaces for extended periods of time. The more space available, reflected in a vessel's crew capacity, the longer a kerbal can live and work without getting stressed out. Events like a lack of food and FreshAir, arguments with other crew members, and low gravity can also cause Stress. And when a kerbal gets stressed out, they'll stop using their skills. You can reduce Stress by letting the kerbal hang out in the Cupola, but you won't gain use of their skills while they're relaxing. To enable Stress, just rename the LifeSupportResources/Stress.txt with the .cfg extension and restart your game. If you already have Kerbal Health then you won't need Stress, but it can serve as an example for how to use roster resources.
	+ And if you have BARIS installed, part failures and staging failures will cause Stress!
	+ Events: Random snacking is now reworked into an event system to add flavor to the game. Kerbals might get the munchies, or eat bad food. Maybe a crew member snores and it causes Stress. With a host of preconditions and outcomes, you can make a number of different and entertaining events. Check out the Snacks.cfg file for examples.
	+ Wiki: updates describe all the preconditions, outcomes and events along with other API objects.
* 2019-0712: 1.20.1 (Angel-125) for KSP 1.7.3
	+ Small update to support the new Hydrazine tutorial.
* 2019-0630: 1.20.0 (Angel-125) for KSP 1.7.2

	+ Updated Snacks Trip Planner in the Docs folder - new Timewarp Calcs tab.
	+ SnacksConverter now has new options:
	+ requiresHomeConnection - Requires connection to homeworld to operate.
	+ minimumCrew - Minimum number of crew that must be in the host part in order to run the converter.
	+ NOTE: Snacks Processor and Soil Recycler don't use these.
		- Fixed NREs generated when converters are added in the editor.
		- Fixed issue where Snacks wasn't being added to parts in the editor.
		- Fixed debug info in SnacksProcessor.
		- Fixed issue where Snack supply window wasn't being updated when the window is opened and snack time happens.
* 2019-0602: 1.16 (Angel-125) for KSP 1.7.1
	+ Added new celestial bodies filter to the snacks supply window.
		- Snacks will now run simulations on a vessel's supplies and converters to estimate how long the vessel's snacks will last.
	+ NOTE: For the simulator to work properly, be sure to visit all your in-flight vessels that have crews aboard after installing this update.
	+ NOTE: The simulator cannot simulate drill operations.
			- Made some improvements to background converter processing. As a bonus, power production & consumption are also run in the background- with Kopernicus support for solar arrays.
			- SnacksConverter now lists the yield resources in the part info window, and shows yield production time remaining in the PAW.
			- Snacks and other resources consumed per day are now calculated based on the solar day length of the homeworld instead of set to the stock 6hrs/24hrs. I'm looking at you, JNSQ...
* 2019-0518: 1.15 (Angel-125) for KSP 1.7.0
	+ Fixed issue where vessels spawned in game for rescue contracts lacked Snacks.
	+ Fixed integration issue with WalkAbout.
	+ The Soil Recycler now uses the Converter Skill from Engineers instead of the Science Skill. Yup, Scientists make Snacks from rocks and (sanitation) Engineers recycle Soil into Snacks.
	+ The converter and recycler won't automatically shut down if they lack an input resource or an output resource is full. Instead they'll wait until they get what they need.
	+ Updated the recycler/processor info view in the editor's part description window.
* 2019-0511: 1.14 (Angel-125) for KSP 1.7.0

	+ Fixed empty mass for the radial snack tin to be in line with similar parts.
	+ Fixed snack resources being locked by default when Snacks are added to in-flight vessels.
	+ Fixed efficiency processing; processors and recyclers output efficiency should now be 10% to 100% efficient based on their efficiency setting.
	+ Fixed issue where converters and processors wouldn't run in the background without at least one Kerbal aboard.
	+ Fixed issue where the Snacks Processor and Soil Recycler wouldn't produce the proper amount of resources while the vessel is in physics range.
	+ Reduced the amount of Snacks per day produced by the stock Mobile Processing Lab. It was a bit OP...
	+ Snack tins now tell you what their resource options are in the part info view.
	+ Added new SnacksConverter part module. It serves as the basis for the existing Snacks Processor and Soil Recycler. It can also produce "YIELD_RESOURCE" units over time just like the greenhouse from Wild Blue Tools. You can even assign effects to the converter!
	+ NOTE: Snacks won't be getting a greenhouse of its own; it's intended to be a lightweight life support system, but I recognize that some players want more sophisticated capabilities. So the tools are there for others to expand upon...

	+ Added a Snacks Trip Planner Excel spreadsheet. You'll find it in the Docs folder. An in-game planner is in the works.
* 2016-1012: 1.4.0 (Angel-125) for KSP 1.1.3
